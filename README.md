# Project-Based-Internship---Home-Credit-Indonesia-

â€œMany people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience. Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data to predict their clients' repayment abilities. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successfu
